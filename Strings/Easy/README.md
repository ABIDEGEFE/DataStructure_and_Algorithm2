## Valid Anagram (LeetCode #242)
- **Approach**: Single hash map approach.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) to touch each item in the string at least once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for single hash map.


## Reverse String (LeetCode #344)
- **Approach**: Used two-pointer technique to reverse the list in-place by swapping characters from both ends.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for a single pass through half the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for constant extra space.


## Palindrome Number (LeetCode #9)
- **Approach**: Convert integer to string, I have used a way of getting the module of each current x, then adding it with the reversed_sum variable. It helps me to secure O(1) space complexity..
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) to access each digit at least once..
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).

## First Unique Character in a String (LeetCode #387)
- **Approach**: Use a hash map to count character frequencies, then find the first character with frequency 1.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for two linear passes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for hash map storage.


## String to Integer (atoi) (LeetCode #8) (MEDIUM LEVEL)
- **Approach**: Build numeric string from digits and sign, handle whitespace and overflow.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for accessing all values at worst case at least once.
- **Space Complexity** - O(1)

  ## Longest Common Prefix (LeetCode #14)
- **Approach**: Compare characters across strings using the shortest stringâ€™s length. O(n*m) time, O(m) space.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n*m), m is for the length of string with minimum value
- **Space Complexity**: O(m)
