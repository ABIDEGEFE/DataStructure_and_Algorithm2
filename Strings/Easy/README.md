## Valid Anagram (LeetCode #242)
- **Approach**: Single hash map approach.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) to touch each item in the string at least once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for single hash map.


## Reverse String (LeetCode #344)
- **Approach**: Used two-pointer technique to reverse the list in-place by swapping characters from both ends.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for a single pass through half the list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for constant extra space.


## Palindrome Number (LeetCode #9)
- **Approach**: Convert integer to string, I have used a way of getting the module of each current x, then adding it with the reversed_sum variable. It helps me to secure O(1) space complexity..
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) to access each digit at least once..
- **Space Complexity**: O(1).
